# Development of ToDo List App

# Overview

## In this practical assignment, you will build a simple ToDo List app using React. The app should allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and mark them as completed. You should use React state and props to manage the app's data and components.

# Requirements

## The app should have the following functionalities:

## Display a list of tasks, with each task's name and completion status.

## Allow users to add new tasks to the list.

## Allow users to edit the name of an existing task.

## Allow users to delete a task from the list.

## Allow users to mark a task as completed or not completed.

## Provide a way to filter the list by completion status (e.g., show only completed tasks or show only incomplete tasks).

## Provide a way to clear all completed tasks from the list.

# Instructions

## 1. Build the ToDo List app according to the requirements above.

## 2. Use React state and props to manage the app's data and components.

## 3. Use React event handlers to respond to user actions (e.g., adding a new task, editing a task name, etc.).

## 4. Use React conditional rendering to show/hide components based on user input (e.g., show only completed tasks or show only incomplete tasks).

## 5. Style the app with CSS or any CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, etc.).

## 6. Make sure your code is well-organized and follows best practices for React development.

# Evaluation

## Your app will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

## 7. Functionality: Does the app meet all the requirements listed above?

## 8. Code quality: Is the code well-organized and easy to read? Does it follow best practices for React development?

## 9. Design: Is the app visually appealing and easy to use?

## 10. Creativity: Did you add any additional features or functionality beyond the basic requirements?

## 11. Documentation: Did you provide clear comments and/or documentation for your code?

# Submission

## When you have finished building your app:

## Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code to the repository.

## Add any additional instructions for running your app in a README.md file in a GitHub repository.

## Email the link to your repository to your examiner

# Website functionality

## The web has two main pages

## 1. Home page: Where you can see all tasks created with their respective times

## 2. Tasks page: Where you can create new tasks

## For editing the current task, click on its title and then click on the button corresponding to the action you want to perform. Whether editing, deleting or getting back to the homepage
